#Feed Parser

This Ruby on Rails Project displays the rss/atom feeds of any feed you add into the database. It's still a major work in progress.

##Features

* Uses Feedzirra to parse multiple types of feeds.
* You can drag the feeds up and down to reorder them. Clicking the Save order in the header will save the order in the database.

##Installation

```
bundle install
```

```
rake db:migrate
```
